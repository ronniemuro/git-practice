Hi my name is Ronnie, I moved to europe when I was only 22, something about the weather, the food, and the overall lifestyle brought me here. I like reading cheesy rom coms, working out some cardio, and pizza. I am excited to know where I will be going next after this Spanish chapter in my life! I am thinking that I will go back to the states for a bit, then move to Mexico DF next :)
