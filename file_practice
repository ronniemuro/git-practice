Hi my name is RONNIE LOPEZ MURO, I moved to europe when I was only 22, something about the weather, the food, and the overall lifestyle brought me here. I like reading cheesy rom coms, working out, and enchiladas. I am excited to know where I will be going next after this Spanish chapter in my life! I am thinking that I will go back to the states for a bit, then move to Chicago next :)

I also learned today that teaching middle schoolers is definitely not my passion.
